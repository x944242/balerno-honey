    <h1>Balerno Honey</h1>
    <p>Ths site is going to be great!</p>
    <p>is produced here in Balerno in small batches from our own apiary. We have one of the best locations in Scotland for honey, with abundant spring pollen and nectar from the rich and biodiverse fauna around the water of leith, local woodlands, meadows and hedgerows. In late spring, and sometimes nectar bearing crops in the nearby farms. By late summer, if weather smiles, the lime treess burst into bloom for a short period in late July sending the bees into an excited frenzy.</p>
